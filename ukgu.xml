Sure enough, Archie’s clue and Suzy’s endless list of Cornish contacts sees the hapless duo rock up in St Columb Major. There they meet Colin, who makes silver-covered balls for the game of hurling. But what exactly is hurling? Even these two can’t miss hurling expert Mayor Paul in his full regalia. Paul explains how hurling is a game played by Town and Country teams in St Columb Major, where the silver ball is thrown and ‘hurled’ between team members, but the pitch consists of the entire town and the goals are miles apart! Fred and Pete soon run out of puff trying to play on their own, but Suzy points them back to the playing fields where the mayor and some children are about to play a game. Fred and Pete’s teams battle it out before returning a silver ball to Suzy to display in the museum</desc>

At the Museum of Cornish Treasures, Archie tells them that their treasure grew up in Cornwall under a big dome, and Suzy sends them to the Eden Project to find out more. Here, they meet Catherine who says their treasure is a type of fruit from a place far away. But how did the fruit get to Cornwall? Suzy buzzes on the Treasure Comm and suggests Fred and Pete take a trip on a zip wire and explore the tropical dome. They meet Catherine again who reveals their treasure is a screw pine fruit. This fruit is usually found in hot countries in Asia and Africa but is able to grow in Eden’s dome because it's so warm inside. Catherine takes Fred and Pete on a plant hunt around the tropical dome. Catherine explains how fruits produce seeds which then grow into new trees that produce fruits themselves</desc>

All the parents and babies have different toys or objects that feel fluffy too, which are explored through play, songs and a story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate fluffy toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, to explore with their baby. Some viewers at home show what fluffy items they’ve been playing with too. The traditional nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb features, as does a story about Baby Bear exploring different textures.

      <desc lang="en">Chris Tarrant explores five countries that were part of Yugoslavia, which had an extensive state-run railway network before its break-up in the 1990s and the Balkan Wars of Independence that followed. From Slovenia, Chris heads east along an old Austro-Hungarian railway that was once used by the Orient Express, pays a visit to a very unusual railway-related battlefield in Bosnia and rides on one of the world's great mountain railways on his way to the Serbian capital Belgrade before finishing his journey in Montenegro</desc>

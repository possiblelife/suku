Even though his team are there to support him, he has to face his fear and take on the pommel, the apparatus that has caused him more than his fair share of problems during the last season. The boys also face the distraction of a trip to an out-of-this-world car museum - but will Winston be able to hold it together when the team comes up against some of the world’s best gymnasts from the USA and France. Back in Birmingham, the display girls get to grips with a new routine in preparation for a performance in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games. Coach Lisa has given the girls a new challenge – not only do they have to perfect their routine, but they also have to choreograph part of it themselves.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Steve Backshall has chosen his UK team of six to travel with him to Bimini in the Bahamas, where they learn how to scuba dive and become the next generation of shark saviours. The mission begins as soon as they land, and they have just two weeks to complete four training dives, but first it’s time to meet four local Bahamian children who are also joining Steve’s team. On board the dive boat, they encounter their first shark species – the Caribbean reef shark – a deadly predator engineered for hunting underwater. Then it’s off to the dive location to start the first series of tests. Some of the team take to diving with ease and soon pass the preliminary stage of their training. For others, it is a much harder challenge, with the tasks proving too much at their first attempt.</desc>

We’ll see how plants in hot, dry parts of world like the desert thrive in their own special ways, like the cactus plant that stores litres of water in its waxy leaves. And we’ll learn how plants that grow close to home in the UK, can grow in a colder and wetter climate.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Two teams touch down at the STARS space station to take on three scientific challenges to win out-of-this world prizes. First, they must decide whether objects will float or sink in a water tank. Then, in a game based on light and shadows, the young scientists have to figure out what their team captains are holding by observing their shadows behind a huge screen. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges they can step across to reach an island. Meanwhile, Sam and Ayo are competing to see who can make the best model rocket. The scientist who loses must clean the other’s dirty lab beakers for a week! Who will triumph?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Kent couple Lou and Andy Webb have two young children affected by a rare genetic condition that severely restricts their eyesight, meaning they only see in black and white and have to wear special goggles in sunlight. Alan Titchmarsh's challenge is to create a more child-friendly garden for their terraced home in Tonbridge, and his first task is to make a shady environment so the kids can spend time outside in the day. After that, he and the team come up with a bespoke lighting system for the evenings, acoustic fencing to cut down the noise from a nearby railway line, and an area for the parents</desc>

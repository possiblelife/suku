All the parents and babies have different toys or objects that feel fluffy too, which are explored through play, songs and a story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate fluffy toy or object inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, to explore with their baby. Some viewers at home show what fluffy items they’ve been playing with too. The traditional nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb features, as does a story about Baby Bear exploring different textures. The Baby Bear Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory bubbles and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

Chantelle heads up the river with some friends looking for signs of water voles, and Rory meets an expert on them in the city. Chantelle and Rory’s fact files help answer all of Tahira questions. With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem, we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, water voles are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Chantelle and the children create water vole masks.</desc>

Parents, carers and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Inside Giovanna’s bag is a night light, and all the parents and babies have different objects and toys that could be used as part of a bedtime routine. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate bedtime objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The baby lullaby Little One Time For Bed features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show what they’ve been doing at bedtime too. The Baby Bear Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory lights and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

      <desc lang="en">After an encounter with a school of migrating tuna, the Octonauts discover that one of the speedy fish, Tina, has been left behind. And she’s injured! Poor Tina has a hook stuck in her mouth and is too weak to swim. After Peso tends to her wound, the Octonauts agree to help get her to the tuna spawning grounds. But they’ll have to be quick: egg-laying season doesn’t last long. Luckily, Tweak’s latest gup, the Gup-R, is the fastest she’s ever built! The Octonauts use it to tow Tina, but when the Gup-R’s battery dies, how will they catch up to the rest of her school?</desc>

Lola begins by rolling out two pieces of pizza dough into big circles. She cooks one in the oven. Lola adds tomato puree to passata to make the filling. She also adds some canned tuna, green olives, and boiled egg. She seasons the mixture with paprika, black pepper and her special ingredient, oregano. Then Lola spreads the filling over the dough, which has been in the oven. She finishes the recipe by adding the last piece of dough on top and then putting it back in the oven to cook. Will Lola's friends find the empanadas tasty? Will they guess her special ingredient? There's a very exciting Spanish surprise waiting for her friends while they enjoy their meal!</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ambulance</title>
      <desc lang="en">The first of two strike days affecting ambulance services across the country begins - the most widescale industrial action for a generation.

Narrated by Christopher Eccleston</desc>

It then enters the Cairngorms National Park, home to some of Europe's finest landscapes as well as valleys steeped in Gaelic folklore. The park's station at Aviemore is home to the Strathspey Railway, where Victorian steam locomotives come to life. There is then a climb to the highest point on Britain's railway network before the train winds its way through Fife. Eventually the route crosses the Forth Bridge before arriving in Scottish capital Edinburgh, admired for its architecture and annual arts festival. Narrated by Bill Nighy</desc>

He then adds garlic puree, ginger puree, chutney and chopped tomatoes to cooked beef mince. Sebastiaan then carefully makes powder out of his special ingredient, cumin seeds, and adds the powder to the beef mixture. Sebastiaan mixes both the vegetables and the beef in an oven dish and flattens them before adding two bay leaves. He adds a topping of milk and egg and then places it in the oven.

The first is a local Merseyside stew called scouse, made with chopped and cooked carrots, potatoes and onions with gravy, cooked beef, bay leaves and her special ingredient: celery. The second is a side of crusty bread. Holly makes a dough and stirs in yoghurt and honey. Then it is topped with more yoghurt and pumpkin seeds and placed in the oven. Holly also serves pickled beetroot and cabbage, a traditional side to scouse. Will Holly's friends enjoy her delicious food, and will they enjoy the celery once it is cooked in her recipe?</desc>

      <desc lang="en">Fred and Pete find a heavy metal thing buried in the sand on the beach. It’s got little windows in, and as Fred discovers, it’s full of gunky seaweed. But what is it? It’s time to head back to the museum to see what Suzy and Archie make of it. Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them. The ‘alien’ is actually Suzy's friend Iain, and he explains that the metal object on his head is a helmet for a very old-fashioned deep sea diving suit. Fred and Pete then wonder what divers do when they’re underwater. Suzy sends them to the other end of the beach to meet Hannah from the Cornish Diving Centre, who tells them about modern diving equipment and how they use it. Hannah invites Fred</desc>

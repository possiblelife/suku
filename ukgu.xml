She also adds some canned tuna, green olives, and boiled egg. She seasons the mixture with paprika, black pepper and her special ingredient, oregano. Then Lola spreads the filling over the dough, which has been in the oven. She finishes the recipe by adding the last piece of dough on top and then putting it back in the oven to cook. Will Lola's friends find the empanadas tasty? Will they guess her special ingredient? There's a very exciting Spanish surprise waiting for her friends while they enjoy their meal!</desc>

First, the teams must guess which animals Sam and Ayo are looking at through their telescope based on a series of clues. Then the teams must work out which season James is talking about by standing under the correct tree. If they’re correct, they’ll get covered in spring blossom, summer sunlight, autumn leaves or winter snow. Finally, the teams learn about structures by building arched bridges that they can step across to reach an island. Meanwhile, Ayo and Sam are packing for a mission in the space capsule, but they can’t carry more than 2.5kg. Can they work out what to take so that their packs aren’t too heavy?</desc>

Chantelle visits a school and discovers that they have a bird box which is currently home to a family of blue tits, whilst Rory meet a young birdwatcher in her garden.

With the help of the Teeny Tiny Creatures poem we discover that, like lots of other teeny tiny creatures, blue tits are superheroes and help our planet in their own special way. In the Teeny Tiny Task, Chantelle and the children make blue tit masks and have fun flying around the school grounds.</desc>

They decide to take the recording to Suzy and Archie at the museum. Archie’s clue says that the song is related to the sea, so Suzy sends them to meet some singers who know all about sailors and their songs. It’s back to the harbour for Fred and Pete. Once there, they meet singing group Figurehead. The ladies explain that the song they’re singing is a sea shanty sung by sailors on board ships. Suzy calls up on the Treasure Comm and sends them off to a nearby ship in the harbour to learn more about why sailors sang shanties. Now they know what sea shanties are for, Fred and Pete decide to test out their sailing skills on their very own vessel. But even on a small boat, the hapless duo get in each other’s way. They decide that the only way to sort things out is to write their very own sea shanty! Finally, Fred and </desc>

She then wraps the potato mixture around her special ingredient, hard-boiled eggs, rolls them in breadcrumbs and puts them in the oven to be cooked. Zahra-Rose also serves a fresh chilli sauce, so her friends can use it for dipping. Not only does Zahra-Rose have beautiful decorations, she also has a surprise picnic planned.

Lizzi explains that seals are often spotted along the Cornish coast, but they're also in danger of getting tangled up in beach rubbish. Suzy rings in on the Treasure Comm and sends Fred and Pete off to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek to discover more. At the sanctuary, Beth-Anne explains that seals are brought to the sanctuary when they get caught up in beach rubbish the sanctuary can definitely make good use of Fred and Pete’s orange treasure.

      <desc lang="en">Bill Nighy narrates the stories of epic train journeys through stunning scenery and natural beauty, beginning with a trip from Inverness to Edinburgh. Not long after setting out, the route passes Culloden, the site of the last pitched battle on British soil. It then enters the Cairngorms National Park, home to some of Europe's finest landscapes as well as valleys steeped in Gaelic folklore. The park's station at Aviemore is home to the Strathspey Railway, where Victorian steam locomotives come to life. There is then a climb to the highest point on Britain's railway network before the train winds its way through Fife. Eventually the route crosses the Forth Bridge before arriving in Scottish capital Edinburgh, admired for its architecture and annual arts festival. Narrated by Bill Nighy</desc>

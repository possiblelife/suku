They decide to take the recording to Suzy and Archie at the museum. Archie’s clue says that the song is related to the sea, so Suzy sends them to meet some singers who know all about sailors and their songs. It’s back to the harbour for Fred and Pete. Once there, they meet singing group Figurehead. The ladies explain that the song they’re singing is a sea shanty sung by sailors on board ships. Suzy calls up on the Treasure Comm and sends them off to a nearby ship in the harbour to learn more about why sailors sang shanties. Now they know what sea shanties are for, Fred and Pete decide to test out their sailing skills on their very own vessel. But even on a small boat, the hapless duo get in each other’s way. They decide that the only way to sort things out is to write their very own sea shanty! Finally, Fred and </desc>

She then wraps the potato mixture around her special ingredient, hard-boiled eggs, rolls them in breadcrumbs and puts them in the oven to be cooked. Zahra-Rose also serves a fresh chilli sauce, so her friends can use it for dipping. Not only does Zahra-Rose have beautiful decorations, she also has a surprise picnic planned.

Archie tells them the treasure might be helpful to a seal and Suzy sends them to meet her seal expert friend, Lizzi. Lizzi explains that seals are often spotted along the Cornish coast, but they're also in danger of getting tangled up in beach rubbish. Suzy rings in on the Treasure Comm and sends Fred and Pete off to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek to discover more. At the sanctuary, Beth-Anne explains that seals are brought to the sanctuary when they get caught up in beach rubbish the sanctuary can definitely make good use of Fred and Pete’s orange treasure.

But what exactly is hurling? Even these two can’t miss hurling expert Mayor Paul in his full regalia. Paul explains how hurling is a game played by Town and Country teams in St Columb Major, where the silver ball is thrown and ‘hurled’ between team members, but the pitch consists of the entire town and the goals are miles apart! Fred and Pete soon run out of puff trying to play on their own, but Suzy points them back to the playing fields where the mayor and some children are about to play a game. Fred and Pete’s teams battle it out before returning a silver ball to Suzy to display in the museum</desc>

In an epic story torn from the headlines, the Octonauts embark on their largest, most complex rescue mission ever: saving the Great Barrier Reef and all the creatures that live there from an invasion of coral-hungry crown-of-thorns starfish. The Octonauts meet a tiny coral polyp looking to find a home on the very same reef where the Octonauts are deploying their new medical base, the Gup-W, and the Gup-P, a specialised first responder emergency vehicle. To save the reef and their new polyp friend, the Octonauts must combine forces with a diverse crew of zapping, splatting and claw-snapping reef creatures to fend off the spiky, coral-munching starfish.</desc>

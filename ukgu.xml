      <desc lang="en">Fifty years ago, 34 per cent of the British population worked in manufacturing. Factories mostly employed women, who made an array of clothes and household items that were sold all over the world. Alex Jones presents this documentary in which a group of modern workers go back in time to learn what life was like for women through the 1960s to the 1980s. They start in a re-creation of 1968, when the bulk of high street clothes were made in the UK. The reality of the production line is a rude awakening for many - long monotonous hours with short breaks and few distractions - a situation made even worse when they open their pay packets</desc>

It’s time to head back to the museum to see what Suzy and Archie make of it. Archie reveals that this object will ‘keep you safe and sound’, while Suzy finds a photo of a friend of hers with a big metal object just like the one Fred and Pete found. She sends them back to the beach to meet him. Fred and Pete arrive on the beach and are startled to see what looks like an alien with a metal object just like theirs, walking up to them. The ‘alien’ is actually Suzy's friend Iain, and he explains that the metal object on his head is a helmet for a very old-fashioned deep sea diving suit. Fred and Pete then wonder what divers do when they’re underwater. Suzy sends them to the other end of the beach to meet Hannah from the Cornish Diving Centre, who tells them about modern diving equipment and how they use it. Hannah invites Fred</desc>

They decide to take the recording to Suzy and Archie at the museum. Archie’s clue says that the song is related to the sea, so Suzy sends them to meet some singers who know all about sailors and their songs. It’s back to the harbour for Fred and Pete. Once there, they meet singing group Figurehead. The ladies explain that the song they’re singing is a sea shanty sung by sailors on board ships. Suzy calls up on the Treasure Comm and sends them off to a nearby ship in the harbour to learn more about why sailors sang shanties. Now they know what sea shanties are for, Fred and Pete decide to test out their sailing skills on their very own vessel. But even on a small boat, the hapless duo get in each other’s way. They decide that the only way to sort things out is to write their very own sea shanty! Finally, Fred and </desc>

The boys show him their treasure which he identifies as a tin miner’s lunchbox. Jack points out that tin miners had very dirty hands, meaning they needed a special kind of lunch in their lunchbox. What could that be? Jack gives them a clue – the words ‘oggie, oggie, oggie!’ Suzy gets in contact via the Treasure Comm and explains that an oggie</desc>

Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Giovanna has got a blue bib and blue sunglasses inside her bag. All the parents and babies have different blue toys and objects in their bags too, which are explored through play, songs and a story. Parents, carers, and their little ones at home are encouraged to hide a safe, baby-appropriate blue object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase, and then play with the items together! The traditional nursery rhyme Little Boy Blue features, as does a story about Baby Bear and Baby Tiger dressing up in blue things, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring the colour blue too. The Together Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory scarves and the Goodbye Song.</desc>

The presenter also reflects on the cathedral's role in a clandestine operation that helped turn the tide of the Second World War</desc>

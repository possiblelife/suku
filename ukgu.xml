These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding safe, baby-appropriate farm objects and toys inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The fun song Old MacDonald Had A Farm features, as does a story involving Baby Bear, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring farm things too.

We’ll discover a tree’s leaves make energy using sunlight, so they can keep growing. We learn that a tree is alive, it drinks and breathes and grows just like we do!

Discover how trees grow, how we can tell the age of trees and how the roots, leaves and bark work. Maddie shows how trees are home to lots of other plants, animals, birds and insects who live on and amongst them and have an important role in our ecosystem. We’ll discover a tree’s leaves make energy using sunlight, so they can keep growing. We learn that a tree is alive, it drinks and breathes and grows just like we do! And we’ll find out about deciduous trees that lose their leaves in winter and evergreens that keep their leaves all year round.</desc>
